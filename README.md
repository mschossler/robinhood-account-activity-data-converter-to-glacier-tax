# Robinhood-account-acctivity-data-converter-to-Glacier-tax
This application converts data from account activity from Robinhood (and other stockbrokers that use a similar format) to the shape required by Glacier tax. It finds and matches stocks that were bought and sold on different days to calculate the profit and ultimately the income taxes for stock transactions for nonresident aliens. It also exports the data in the format required to be uploaded into glaciertax.com.

You may find it difficult to retrieve the information from the 1099-B form from Robinhood and add it to Glacier if you buy and sell stocks frequently. This application was created to facilitate this process. Here are the steps you have to follow:

1- Contact Robinhood (or other stockbrokers) to obtain an account activity (or transaction history) from your first transaction until 12/31/2020 in CSV format with heads (this is the standard heads for Robinhood):
Activity,Date,Process,Date,Settle,Date,Account,Type,Instrument,Description,Trans,Code,Quantity,Price,Amount,Suppressed

2- Bring the file account_acctivity.csv (with this name) to the same folder as the file taxes2020.ipynb. 

3- Run the code using Jupyter (check item 4 if you can't use Jupyter) and you should obtain a file 2020tax1099-B.csv with heads:
name,acquired,sold,proceeds,cost

4- If you don't have Jupyter installed in your machine you may upload taxes2020.ipynb and account_acctivity.csv to Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index#scrollTo=0cE_xvj-KuHw). The files must be in the same folder. Run the code. you may convert the file to .py and run it with your favorite python compiler as well. Libraries used are Pandas and io.

5- Follow the instructions to use the plugging from https://github.com/JiahaoShan/Glacier-tax-1099-B-Stock-Transactions-Helper to upload the file 2020tax1099-B.csv to glaciertax.com.

Updates/generalizations will be made for 2021 and beyond.

Enjoy!
